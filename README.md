This project is aimed to introduce a lightweight client to get data from the TeamCity API.

The main requirement is to get different users' running builds restricting info to the following fields:
- ID
- buildTypeId
- number
- status
- state

E.g., `id="â€Ž3344879" buildTypeId="OpenSourceProjects_Sample_Buld" number="2025" status="UNKNOWN" state="finished"`
